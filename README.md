## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Rust toolchain (1.70 or later)
-   Network connectivity (for public IP detection)

### Using Cargo (Recommended)

```bash
# Install the latest version
cargo install myip-tui

# Or specify a version
cargo install myip-tui@0.1.0
```

### Setting up PATH

After installation, make sure your Rust binary directory is in your PATH:

```bash
# For Bash users (add to ~/.bashrc)
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:'"$HOME"'/.cargo/bin' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# For Zsh users (add to ~/.zshrc)
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:'"$HOME"'/.cargo/bin' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For Zsh users (if .zshrc is not working)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshenv
source ~/.zshenv

# Verify installation
myip
```

## Usage

Simply run the application from your terminal:

```bash
myip
```

### Keyboard Controls

| Key   | Action           |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| `q`   | Quit application |
| `ESC` | Quit application |

## Interface Details

MyIP provides a detailed view of your network interfaces in a clean, organized terminal UI:

### Main Screen Elements

1. **Header**: Displays your hostname
2. **Public IP**: Shows your external IP address (fetched from online services)
3. **Interface Panels**: Each network interface is displayed with:
    - Status (up/down)
    - IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    - MAC address (when available)
    - MTU and link speed (when available)
    - RX/TX traffic statistics
    - Real-time traffic graph
4. **Debug Panel**: Shows detected interfaces and diagnostic information
5. **Footer**: Displays keyboard controls

### Network Traffic Graphs

Each interface panel includes a real-time graph that visualizes:

-   **RX (Download)**: Shown in green
-   **TX (Upload)**: Shown in red

The graph automatically scales based on traffic volume and provides meaningful units (B/s, KB/s, MB/s).

### Public IP Detection

MyIP attempts to fetch your public IP address from multiple services:

-   api.ipify.org
-   ifconfig.me/ip
-   icanhazip.com
-   ipinfo.io/ip
-   myexternalip.com/raw

The application uses a 5-second timeout to ensure responsiveness even if connectivity is limited.

## Building from Source

MyIP is built with Rust and uses several key dependencies:

-   **ratatui**: Terminal user interface library
-   **crossterm**: Terminal control and input handling
-   **tokio**: Asynchronous runtime
-   **reqwest**: HTTP client for fetching public IP
-   **sysinfo**: System information gathering
-   **local-ip-address**: Network interface detection

To build from source:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myip.git
cd myip

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release

# The binary will be available at
./target/release/myip
```

### Dependencies

MyIP requires the following dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
ratatui = "0.20"
crossterm = "0.25"
anyhow = "1.0"
local-ip-address = "0.5.1"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
sysinfo = "0.27.8"
nix = "0.26.2"
futures = "0.3"
gethostname = "0.4.1"
reqwest = { version = "0.11", features = ["json", "default-tls"] }
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**No Public IP Displayed**

-   Check your internet connection
-   The application tries multiple services, so one may be blocked
-   Ensure you have the `default-tls` feature enabled in reqwest

**Missing Network Statistics**

-   Some interfaces may not provide statistics through sysinfo
-   The application attempts to fall back to using the `netstat` command
-   Check the debug panel for interfaces with missing statistics

**Network Interfaces Not Showing**

-   Ensure you're running with appropriate permissions
-   Some virtual interfaces or non-standard interfaces may not be detected
-   Check the debug panel to see which interfaces were detected
